# italk
## Brief About the Idea: 
italk is an AI‑powered chatting platform that creates digital personality clones of users by learning from their conversations over time.
These AI clones develop consistent tone, preferences, decision styles, and communication patterns.
Once created, the clones can interact autonomously with other user clones, enabling agent‑to‑agent communication that mimics real human interaction.
