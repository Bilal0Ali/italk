## 🚀 What is italk?

**italk** is an AI-powered chatting platform that creates **digital personality clones** of users by learning from their conversations over time.

These AI clones develop **consistent tone, preferences, decision styles, and communication patterns**, closely reflecting how a person thinks and interacts.

Once created, clones can **interact autonomously with other user clones**, enabling **agent-to-agent communication** that mimics real human interaction — without requiring humans to be constantly present.

---

## 🧩 Core Idea

> *What if your AI could talk to someone else’s AI before you ever do?*

italk explores this idea by allowing clones to:
- Debate
- Interact playfully
- Evaluate compatibility for real-world relationships

This makes it possible to **simulate interactions before committing time, emotion, or resources**.

---

## ✨ Key Features

### 🧠 Digital Personality Clones
- Built from user conversations
- Learn tone, opinions, values, and communication style
- Evolve continuously over time

---

### 💬 Clone Talks
A dedicated space where **two AI clones interact with each other**.

#### Modes:
- **Debate Mode**  
  Structured, turn-based debates on selected topics.

- **Roast Mode**  
  Light-hearted, humorous interactions showcasing personality and wit.

- **Compatibility Meter (Clone ↔ Clone)**  
  Evaluates how well two people might work together *before* they interact directly.

---

### ❤️ Compatibility Meter (Clone ↔ Clone)
Compatibility is measured **between two clones**, not between a human and a clone.

#### Supported use cases:
- Romantic relationships
- Roommates
- Study partners
- Business partners
- Team formation

#### Evaluation dimensions include:
- Communication style
- Conflict handling
- Decision-making patterns
- Emotional tone
- Value alignment

The result is a **probabilistic compatibility score**, along with insights and risk flags.
